			<p>Ciphers, cryptography and encryption are the new way for users to hide their data from unwanting eyes, middlemen,
				hackers and attackers. Data is invaluable in todays society and protecting that data should be a person or
				companies top priority.<br /><br />

				Encryption is used by every major and minor company over the world to hide their employees, customers and
				sensitive company data including user passwords, login details, credit card details and network traffic traveling
				throughout the company network. However, a company may spend the time protecting their information but the
				cipher they use will make all the difference.<br /><br />
				
				If each company used the same well known cipher everyone would be at risk of a cyber security attack and cracking.
				This website aims to allow users to encrypt and decrypt simple shift ciphers such as Rot13, which encrypts
				a letter by replacing it with the letter 13 spaces infront and Caesar Cipher which encrypts a letter by shifting it a random
				amount forward.<br /><br />
				
				Creating a design which is user friendly and also appealing to the eye may cause this coursework to be a challenge
				as different people have different opinions on regards to design. Some may like bulky web pages or some
				may like a more simplistic design. Moreover, some user may like bright colours that catch their attention and some
				may be lower toned pastel like colours. This design aims for a simplistic design with a color scheme in the middle
				of the "bright" to "pastel" spectrum.</p></div>
